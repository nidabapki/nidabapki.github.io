<h1>Nidaba</h1>

Nidaba is a distributed scalable public key infrastructure that can be used as a DNS, an authentication system or a certificate authority.

Nidaba has distinguished properties. Among them are resistance to the cyber squaters & vandals and resistance to the tragedy of the commons. Besides that Nidaba is scalable, uses the supply and demand model to provide a stable price for the name operations on the external markets and to fork its blockchain behindhand is as hard as to fork Bitcoin's blockchain.

The details you can find in [the whitepaper]({{ site.url }}/files/nidaba.pdf).
