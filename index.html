<h1><span>Nidaba</span></h1>

<p>Nidaba is a distributed scalable naming system that can be used as a DNS, an an authentication system or as a certificate authority. Nidaba is based on the Bitcoin protocol and similar to Namecoin, but has some distinguished properties. You can find the details in <a href="{{ site.url }}/files/nidaba.pdf">the whitepaper</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>
        After the whitepaper was timestamped I made some minor changes to the core ideas of Nidaba: 
        added<sup><a href="{% post_url 2014-06-12-pow-meets-pos %}">[1]</a></sup> proof of stake to resists to 51%-attack and got rid<sup><a href="{% post_url 2014-06-23-auction %}">[2]</a></sup> of penny auction.

<h2><span>Nidaba vs. certificate authority</span></h2>

<p>Current web is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority#CA_compromise">trust to the certificates authorities</a>. If any is compromised then a malefactor can steal one's identity and organise a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attact</a>. Of cause a CA can compromise itself by a request of the government agencies. Nidaba is based on idea that you trust no one.</p>
