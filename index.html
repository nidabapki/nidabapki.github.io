<h1>Nidaba</h1>

<p>Nidaba is a distributed scalable naming system that can be used as a DNS, an authentication system or a certificate authority.</p>

<p>Nidaba has distinguished properties. Among them are resistance to the cyber squaters &amp; vandals and resistance to the tragedy of the commons. Besides that Nidaba is scalable, uses the supply and demand model to provide a stable price for the name operations on the external markets and to fork its blockchain behindhand is as hard as to fork Bitcoin's blockchain.</p>
