Nidaba is the Sumerian goddess of writing and harvest. It turns out that her name is the perfect name for a distributed pki based on blockchain technologies.

There is a classic analogy between gold and Bitcoin. We can imagine the active nodes of the Bitcoin network as the miners which mine the same gold-field. The field was rich at the beginning of mining but it becomes unproductive with time. As you see there is a limited amount of <s>gold</s> bitcoins.

With Nidaba there is another analogy. The internal currency is a crop and the active nodes are farmers. The internal currency may rot just like a crop. Also the supply of the crop/internal currency can be raised at any time if more people become farmers/active nodes, but this would drop the price for the crop/currency on the market and the inefficiency farmers/active nodes give up farming/supporting the network.

As I mention before, Nidaba is the Sumerian goddess of writing and harvest. Both this activities match the ideas behind the system. Blockchain keeps all the system's history and [the history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_history) itself begins with the invention of writing. The link between the distributed PKI and a harvest I highlighted in the previous paragraph.
